# Introducing WashikaDao

Washika DAO, a swahili word for “Stakeholders” (Washikadau) is a framework and protocol aimed at transforming governance and financial inclusion for marginalized communities such as Village Community Banks (VICOBAs), Savings and Credit Cooperative Societies (SACCOS), and Chamas across communities in the global south. Built on the Celo blockchain and leveraging the use of stablecoins, Washika DAO provides a robust platform for savings, lending, and governance, designed to empower communities and promote sustainable economic growth.
Our focus is on scalable solutions that integrate innovation with existing community practices, such as the Washika DAO protocol, to create sustainable economic growth and resilience, while critically assessing the trade-offs and impacts on marginalized communities. By examining the potential of novel credit systems to empower local economies, enhance financial autonomy, and reduce dependency on conventional traditional structures.
Leveraging decentralized finance (DeFi) technologies and community-driven models. Central to this exploration is the question: At what cost are marginalized communities truly financially included?
